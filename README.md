# Elegoo-Smart-Car-V4
My own slightly modified version of the Elegoo Smart Car V4

I got this car last summer because I wanted to build an arduino-based floor-mopping robot. I modified this car by removing the two front wheels and rubber-banding a mop to the front. However, the code I have is still capable of controlling the two front wheels.
